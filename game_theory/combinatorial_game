# Impartial Game v.s. Partisan Game:
 Impartial: the set of moves available from any given position is the same for both players
 Partisan: each player has a different set of possible moves from a given position

# Normal v.s. Misere:
 Normal: last player with move wins
 Misere: last player with move loses

# N position v.s. P position:
 N: next move can be zero
 P: previous move

# Nim-Sum : The cumulative XOR value of the number of coins/stones in each piles/heaps at any point of the game is called Nim-Sum at that point.

# Theorem:
If both A and B play optimally (i.e- they don’t make any mistakes), then the player starting first is guaranteed to win if the Nim-Sum at the beginning of the game is non-zero. Otherwise, if the Nim-Sum evaluates to zero, then player A will lose definitely.

Proof:
Lemma 1. If s = 0, then t != 0 no matter what move is made.

Lemma 2. If s != 0, it is possible to make a move so that t = 0.

# eg: suppose starts with (3, 4, 5)
3 xor 4 xor 5 = 2
since 1 xor 4 xor 5 = 0, take 3 - 1 = 2 from 3 -> P position

# Grundy Number
 # Mex:
 'Minimum excludant' a.k.a 'Mex' of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative number not present in the set.
 # Grundy Number:
  lost: 0
  otherwise: mex of nimbers of next position

# Eg1. 1 pile, any amount
N      0 1 2 3 4 5 ...
Grundy 0 1 2 3 4 5 ...

# Eg2. 1 pile, at most 3 stones
N         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Grundy(n) 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2

# Sprague-Grundy Theorem
 Suppose there is a composite game (more than one sub-game) made up of N sub-games and two players, A and B. Then Sprague-Grundy Theorem says that if both A and B play optimally (i.e., they don’t make any mistakes), then the player starting first is guaranteed to win if the XOR of the grundy numbers of position in each sub-games at the beginning of the game is non-zero.

# How to apply Sprague Grundy Theorem ?
In any 'Impartial' Game:
 1. Break the composite game into sub-games.
 2. Then for each sub-game, calculate the Grundy Number at that position.
 3. Then calculate the XOR of all the calculated Grundy Numbers.
 4. If the XOR value is non-zero, then the player who is going to make the turn (First Player) will win else he is destined to lose, no matter what.
