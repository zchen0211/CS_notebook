Effects of Congestion
 As delay increases, performance decreases.
 If delay increases, retransmission occurs, making situation worse.

Congestion control algorithms
 Leaky Bucket Algorithm

Steps:
 1. When host wants to send packet, packet is thrown into the bucket.
 2. The bucket leaks at a constant rate, meaning the network interface transmits packets at a constant rate.
 3. Bursty traffic is converted to a uniform traffic by the leaky bucket.
 4. In practice the bucket is a finite queue that outputs at a finite rate.

Token bucket Algorithm
 In order to deal with the bursty traffic we need a flexible algorithm so that the data is not lost. One such algorithm is token bucket algorithm.

Steps:
 1. In regular intervals tokens are thrown into the bucket.
 2.The bucket has a maximum capacity.
 3. If there is a ready packet, a token is removed from the bucket, and the packet is send.
 4. If there is no token in the bucket, the packet cannot be send.

 FIFO queue

The following is an algorithm for variable-length packets:
 1. Initialize a counter to n at the tick of the clock.
 2. If n is greater than the size of the packet, send the packet and decrement the counter by the packet size. Repeat this step until n is smaller than the packet size.
 3. Reset the counter and go to step 1.
