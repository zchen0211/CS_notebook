# Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
# http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/
Since IP does not have a inbuilt mechanism for sending error and control messages. It depends on Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) to provide an error control. It is used for reporting errors and management queries. It is a supporting protocol and used by networks devices like routers for sending the error messages and operations information.

# Source quench message:
Source quench message is request to decrease traffic rate for messages sending to the host(destination). Or we can say, when receiving host detects that rate of sending packets (traffic rate) to it is too fast it sends the source quench message to the source to slow the pace down so that no packet can be lost.

ICMP will take source IP from the discarded packet and informs to source by sending source quench message.

Then source will reduce the speed of transmission so that router will free for congestion.

When the congestion router is far away from the source the ICMP will send hop by hop source quench message so that every router will reduce the speed of transmission.

# Parameter problem:
Whenever packets come to the router then calculated header checksum should be equal to recieved header checksum then only packet is accepted by the router.

If there is mismatch packet will be dropped by the router.

ICMP will take the source IP from the discarded packet and informs to source by sending parameter problem message.

# Time exceeded message :
When some fragments are lost in a network then the holding fragment by the router will be droped then ICMP will take source IP from discarded packet and informs to the source, of discarded datagram due to time to live field reaches to zero, by sending time exceeded message.

# Introduction and IPv4 Datagram Header
# http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-introduction-ipv4/
# Responsibilities of Network Layer:
 1. Packet forwarding/Routing of packets:
 2. Connectionless communication(IP):
 3. Fragmentation of data packets:

# Circuit Switch vs Packet Switch

# IPv4:
IPv4 is a connectionless protocol used for packet switched networks. It operates on best effort delivery model, in which neither delivery is guaranteed, nor proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate delivery is assured.

IPv4 Datagram Header: Header + Data
Header (20 - to bytes):
 VER:   Version of the IP protocol (4 bits), which is 4 for IPv4
 HLEN:  IP header length (4 bits), which is the number of 32 bit 
       words in the header. Minimum value for this field is 5
       and the maximum is 15
 Type of service: Low Delay, High Throughput, Reliability (8 bits)
 Total Length:    Length of header + Data (16 bits), which has a 
                 minimum value 20 bytes and maximum is 65,535 bytes
 Identification:  Unique Packet Id for identifying the group of 
                 fragments of a single IP datagram (16 bits)
 Flags:           3 flags of 1 bit each : reserved bit (must be zero),
                 do not fragment flag, more fragments flag (same order)
 Fragment Offset: Specified in terms of number of 8 bytes, which has 
                 the maximum value of 65,528 bytes
 Time to live:  Datagram’s lifetime (8 bits), It prevents the datagram 
               to loop in the network
 Protocol:     Name of the protocol to which the data is to be passed 
              (8 bits)
 Header Checksum:  16 bits header checksum for checking errors in the 
                  datagram header
 Source IP address: 32 bits IP address of the sender
 Destination IP address: 32 bits IP address of the receiver
 Option: Optional information such as source route

# IP Addressing: Classful
# http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ip-addressing-introduction-and-classful-addressing/
IP address is an address having information about how to reach a specific host, especially outside the LAN. An IP address is a 32 bit unique address having an address space of 2^32. 

# Classful Addressing:
Class A (IP address belonging to class A are assigned to the networks that contain a large number of hosts.):
 The network ID is 8 bits long.
 The host ID is 24 bits long.
 0.0.0.0 -> 127.255.255.255
Class B (IP address belonging to class B are assigned to the networks that ranges from medium-sized to large-sized networks.):
 The network ID is 16 bits long.
 The host ID is 16 bits long.
 128.0.0.0 -> 191.255.255.255
Class C (IP address belonging to class C are assigned to small-sized networks.):
 The network ID is 24 bits long.
 The host ID is 8 bits long.
 192.0.0.0 -> 223.255.255.255
Class D (IP address belonging to class D are reserved for multi-casting.):
 224.0.0.0 -> 239.255.255.255
Class E (IP addresses belonging to class E are reserved for experimental and research purposes.):
 240.0.0.0 -> 255.255.255.255

# Range of special IP addresses:
 169.254.0.0 – 169.254.0.16 : Link local addresses
 127.0.0.0 – 127.0.0.8 : Loop-back addresses
 0.0.0.0 – 0.0.0.8 : used to communicate within the current network.

# IP Addressing: Classless Addressing
# http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ip-addressing-classless-addressing/
# Network Address and Mask
The default mask in different classes are :
 Class A – 255.0.0.0
 Class B – 255.255.0.0
 Class C – 255.255.255.0

# Longest Prefix Matching in Routers
# http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks-longest-prefix-matching-in-routers/
IP prefix is a prefix of IP address. All computers on one network have same IP prefix. For example, in 192.24.0.0/18, 18 is length of prefix and prefix is first 18 bits of the address.

# Traceroute
# http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks-traceroute/
traceroute google.com

# How does traceroute make sure that a packet is dropped at i’th hop?
It uses TTL field for this purpose. TTL is set as 1 for first packet(s), then 2 and so on until destination is reached.

# How is total time estimated?
When a packet is dropped, the router sends an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source. That is how source figures out total time.

# What’s difference between Ping and Traceroute?
# http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/whats-difference-between-ping-and-traceroute/
Ping -
 It is a utility that helps one to check if a particular IP address is accessible or not. Ping works by sending a packet to the specified address and waits for the reply. It also measures round trip time and reports errors.
 Ping is also used in checking if the computers on a local network are active. For this, the user has to go in command prompt and type : ping 127.0.0.1, and if the address is active, the ping would return a message like this :

Traceroute -
 It is utility  that traces a packet from your computer to the host, and will also show the number of steps (hops) required to reach there, along with the time by each step. Traceroute works by sending the packets of data with low survival time (Time to Live – TTL) which specifies how many steps (hops) can the packet survive before it is returned.

The main difference between Ping and Traceroute is that Ping is a quick and easy utility to tell if the specified server is reachable and how long will it take to send and receive data from the server whereas Traceroute finds the exact route taken to reach the server and time taken by each step (hop).
